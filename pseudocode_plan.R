# Merge pre and post data

# Drop "other" empty variables

# Generate descriptive stats (n, specialty vs generalist, resident vs staff, #
# of ASD patients)

# Calculate descriptive stats on perceived barriers before and after

# Calculate pre and post scores on for those who completed both surveys on
# comfort with M-CHAT-R, value of the instrument, barriers to implementation

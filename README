Analysis of M-CHAT-R Quality Improvement Project

This is the data and code used to analyze a project we are performing in the general pediatrics clinic at Tripler AMC. The objective of the project is to determine how the implementation of the new autism screening tool M-CHAT-R impacts the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pediatricians in our clinic.

This project uses the ProjectTemplate library of R. (http://projecttemplate.net)

To load the data and run the cleaning steps, source src/eda.R. Exploratory analyses are also contained in this folder.
